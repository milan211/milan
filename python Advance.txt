OOPs Principles:
-----------------
These are nothing but certain rules & guidelines
Different oops principles are

1) Encapsulation
2) Inheritance
3) Polymorphism
4) Abstraction

If we implement the business applications in any prg language according to oops principles.
Then we will get following benfits in those applications.

1) Security
2) Flexibility
3) Reusability

Object Oriented Programing Languages:
------------------------------------

A program language which provides special syntax to implement the applications in those languages according to oops principles are known as Object OrientedPrograming Languages.

ex: c++, java, .net, python, etc ......

			    	
			   |Data:
			   |----> cno,cname,cadd,cacount,cbal
	|--------> customer
	|		   |Operations:
	|		   |----> deposit,witdrawl,balenq,transfer
Bank----
	|                   
	|		   |Data:
	|		   |-----> eid,ename,eadd 
	|---------> Employee
			   |Operations:
			   |-----> HRA,tax,PF,takehome


D2: 
-----

If we implement the organization usecases in python language according to the procedure orientation machanisem then security will miss for the global variables.

ex:
---
cname=None   #None is a default value for all the variables in ptyhon
cadd=None    
cacno=None
cbal=None
eid=None
ename=None
eadd=None
esal=None


def deposit():  # def is keyword which represents as a method
    print("deposit")
    
def withdraw():
    print("withdraw")

def transfer():
    print("transfer")

def balenq():
    print("balenq")
    
def hra():
    print("hra")

def tax():
    print("tax")

def pf():
    print("pf")

def takehome():
    print("takehome")


1) Encapsulation :
------------------
The concept of binding  related data members & along with related functionalities is known as a encapsulation.

ex: 
---

customer Data & operations
--------------------------
cname=None   #None is a default value for all the variables in ptyhon
cadd=None
cacno=None
cbal=None

def deposit():
    print("deposit")
    
def withdraw():

    print("withdraw")

def transfer():
    print("transfer")
def balenq():
    print("balenq")



employee data & operations
--------------------------
eid=None
ename=None
eadd=None
esal=None

def hra():
    print("hra")

def tax():
    print("tax")

def pf():
    print("pf")

def takehome():
    print("takehome")



Class:
------
Class is a syntax or structure is used to group related data members along with related
functionalities.

syntax:
-------
class className()
   """doc str"""
   -------------
   -------------
   -------------

Documentation String:
---------------------
Documentation String of a class is used to provide the information about the class.
Within the class syntax Documentation String is optional.But it is highly recomended.

ex:
---
class Test:
    """Sample class to test doc str"""
help(Test)
help(str)
    
Within the class we can represent the data by using the variables.
We can declare 3-types of variables within the class.They are
1) static variables
2) non-static variables
3) local variables

Within the class we can represent the operations by using methods.
We can define 3-types of methods within the class.They are
1) static methods
2) non-static methods
3) class methods


The concept of allocating memory space for non-static variables of a class @ runtime dynamically is known as a object (or) instance of a class is known as a object.

syntax: referenceVariable = classname() --> it is Object creation statement

after creating the object python interpreter takes the original address of the object creates indirect address based on the original address ,and gives the indirect address to the variable.The variable which is storing the indirect address of the object is known as reference variable.

Through the reference variable we can put the data into the object, we can get the
data from the object & we can call the methods on the object.

The indirect address which is created by the python interpreter based on the original address of the object contains 2 parts.

1) Class Name
2) HexaDecemial representation of hash code

We can create N-no.of  Objects for a class.
2-differet objects of same class or 2-differet objects of different classes does not contain same address.

ex: 
---
class Test:
    """Sample class to test doc str"""
    def display(self):
        print("welcome")
t1=Test()
print(t1)
t1.display()
t2=Test()
print(t2)
t2.display()


O/P:
----
<__main__.Test object at 0x000001D7BC5939E8>
welcome

<__main__.Test object at 0x000001D7BC585E80>
welcome


Static Variables:
-----------------
.Variables which are declared within the class outside of all the methods are known as static variables.

The data which is commom for all the objects.Is recommended to represent by using
static variables.

For all the static varaibles of a class memory will be allocated only once.

Static variables of one class we can access within the same class & outside of the class by using className.


ex1:
----
class X:
    a=1000
    b=2000
    def m1(self):
        print(X.a)
        print(X.b)
   
obj=X()
obj.m1()
print(X.a)
print(X.b)
print(obj.a)
print(obj.b)


O/P:

        print(X.b)
    def modify(self):
        X.a=X.a+100
        X.b=X.b-100
      
        
obj=X()
obj.display()
obj.modify()
obj.display()	

obj2=X()

Non Static variables:
---------------------
The variables which are declared within the class by using self: are known as non static variables.

The data which is seprate for every object is recommended by using non static variables.

For all the non static varaibles of a class memory will be allocated within the object.

Non static variables of one class we can access within the same class by using self:

Non static variables of one class we can access from outside of the class by using
reference variable.

ex1:
----
class X:
    def insert(self):
        self.a = 1000
        self.b = 2000
    
    def display(self):
        print(self.a)
        print(self.b)

        print(self.b)

    def modify(self):
        self.a=self.a+100

Constructors:
--------------
Constructor is a special method ,which is used to define & initialize non-static variables of a class @ the time of creating the object.

Diferences b/w method & Constructors:
--------------------------------------
Methods:
--------
1) Method name can be any name.
2) Method will be executed when ever we make a method call.
3) wrt one object one method can called for N no of times.
4) methods are used to represent the business logics to perform the operations.


Constructors:
-------------
1) Constructor name must be __init__
2) Constructor will be executed automatically when ever we create object.
3) wrt one object one constructor will be executed only once.
4) Constructors are used  to defined & initialized non static variables of a class@ the time of creation of the object.

ex1:
----
class Test:
    def __init__(self):
        print("in constructor of Test")
    def display(self):
        print("welcome to display")

3) Local Variables:
-------------------
The variables which are declared within the method body are known as Local variables.

The data which is required to use within a particular method is recommended to
represent by using local variables.

For all the local variables of a method memory will be allocated when ever we make
a method call.

Local variables of one method can't be accessed from outside of that method.

ex:
---
class Test:
    def m1(self):
        a=1000
        b=2000
        print(a)
        print(b)
    def m2(self):
        c=3000
        d=4000
        print(c)
        print(d)
        #print(a)

Garbage Collection:
-------------------
The concept of removing unused objects from memory location is known as Garbage Collection.

If reference count of any object becomes zero,then we called that object as a unused object.

The no.of reference variables which are pointing a object is known as a reference count of the object.

@ the time execution of the program,if any object reference count becomes zero.Then python interpretter calls the garbage collector.

Garbage collector is s predefined prgm or background thread,which removes unused objects from the memory location.

After executing the garbage collector prgm more memory space available space is available to the prgm.And rest of the prgm execution becomes faster.

ex:
----
class X:
    def m1(self):
        print("in m1 of x")
        
x1=X()
x1.m1()
print(x1)

Destructor:
-----------
Destructor is a special method and name of the Destructor must be "__del__".

Destructor of a class will be executed automatically when ever object is created from memory location.

It is recomended to represent resource releasing stmts or resourse ralocation stmts. 

ex:
---
class X:
   def __init__(self):
       print("in constructor of X")
   def m1(self):

Del:
----
"del" is a keyword,which removes give variables from the memory location.
When ever variable is deleted from memory location,the variable pointed object 
reference count is decreased by 1.

Inheritance:
------------
Preperties of one class to another class directly like a same class members is known as a inheritance.

Class which is extends by another classs is known as super classs or base class.

A class which is extending another class is known as subclass or derived class.

Super class properties directly can be used with in the subclass like as a subclass members.

Types of Inheritance:
----------------------

1) Single Inheritance:
----------------------
The concept of inheriting from only one class to another class is known as a single inheritance.

ex:
---
class X:
    def m1(self):
        print("in m1 of X")

x1=X()
a=x1.__hash__()
print(a)
x1.m1()


O/P:
----
-9223371941492075611
in m1 of X



2) Multilevel:
--------------
Concept of inheriting the properties from multiple classes  in a concept of one after the another is known as a multilevel inheritance.

ex:
---
class X:
    def m1(self):
        print("in m1 of X")
class Y(X):
    def m2(self):
        print("in m2 of Y")
class Z(Y):
    def m3(self):
        print("in m3 of Z")

z1=Z()
a=z1.__hash__()
print(a)
z1.m1()
z1.m2()
z1.m3()


O/P:

in m2 of Y
in m3 of Z


3) Hirarchial Inheritance:
--------------------------
The concept of inheriting the properties from one class to multiple classes is known as a 
Hirarchial Inheritance.

ex:
---
class X:
    def m1(self):
        print("in m1 of X")
class Y(X):
    def m2(self):
        print("in m2 of Y")
class Z(X):
    def m3(self):
        print("in m3 of Z")

y1=Y()
a=y1.__hash__()
print(a)
y1.m1()
y1.m2()


z1=Z()
b=z1.__hash__()
print(b)
z1.m1()
z1.m3()

4) Multiple Inheritance:
------------------------
Concept of inheriting the properties from multiple classes into single class @ a time is known as a multipe inheritance.

class Y:
    def m2(self):
        print("in m2 of Y")
class Z(X,Y):
    def m3(self):
        print("in m3 of Z")


z1=Z()
b=z1.__hash__()
print(b)
z1.m1()

5) cyclic Inheritance:
----------------------
The concept of inheriting the properties from  sub class is known as cyclic inheritance.
Python doesn't support cyclic inheritance.


ex:
---
class X(Z):
    def m1(self):
        print("in m1 of X")
class Y(X):
    def m1(self):
        print("in m2 of Y")
class Z(Y):
    def m3(self):
        print("in m3 of Z")


z1=Z()

When ever we define multiple methods with the same name with same no.of parameters or different number of parameters within a class,
by default python interpreter recognises last defined method only.

Method Overriding:
------------------
The concept of defining multiple methods with the same name with same no.of parameters or defirrent no.of parameters one is in super & another in sub class is known as method overriding.

When ever we override superclass method within subclass & by default subclass method will be executed,if subclass object is created.

---
class X:
    def m1(self):
        print("in no param m1 of X") #old logic

Abstarction:
------------
The concept of hiding the properties of a class from the outside of a class is known as a Abstraction.

We can hide the properties of a class from outside of a class by using "__" syntax

Hidden properties of a class cann't be accessed from outside of a class.

ex:
---
class X:
    __a=1000
    def __m1(self):
        print("in mi in X")
    def display(self):
        print(X.__a)

Regular Expression
-----------------
what is a regular expression?
A string that defines a text matching pattern.

emails id
phone
zip
credit card


jill rollnumber is 1001
bob  rollnumber is 1002
rob  rollnumber is 1003
jack rollnumber is 1004

regular expression
  
  \d\d\d\d

extract rollnumbers

1001
1002
1003
1004

what is advantage of using regex?
writing only very few lines.
